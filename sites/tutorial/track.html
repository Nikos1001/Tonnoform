      the bottom right corner[2].

      by pressing the minus in the bottom right corner[2].

      To edit a pattern, select it. To add a note, click and drag in the Pattern editor. To extend / shorten a note,
      click and drag on a note. To remove a note, right click it. To scroll the Pattern editor up / down, use
      the up / down arrow keys.

      <large>Sequencer</large>

      The Sequencer is used to arrange patterns into a song. The Sequencer is the panel at the bottom of the screen. To add a pattern
      to the Sequencer, select the pattern and click
      where you want to place the pattern[1]. The added pattern will use whichever instrument you have selected[2]. To remove
      a pattern from the Sequencer, right click it. To switch the selected instrument, click on the instrument name in the bottom
      left corner[2].
